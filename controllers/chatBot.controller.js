It can affect any part of the body, and there are over 100 different types of cancer.\n\nCancer cells are typically characterized by their ability to:\n\n* **Divide and multiply rapidly:** Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, forming a mass or tumor.\n* **Invade and destroy surrounding tissue:** Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy tissue, leading to organ damage and dysfunction.\n* **Spread to other parts of the body:** Cancer cells can spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other parts of the body, forming new tumors (metastasis).\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* **Genetic mutations:** Changes in the DNA of cells can lead to cancer.\n* **Environmental factors:** Exposure to certain chemicals, radiation, and other environmental hazards can increase the risk of cancer.\n* **Lifestyle factors:** Certain lifestyle choices, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor diet, can contribute to cancer development.\n\nThe symptoms of cancer vary depending on the type and location of the cancer. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* **Lumps or bumps in the body**\n* **Pain**\n* **Fatigue**\n* **Weight loss**\n* **Changes in bowel or bladder habits**\n* **Skin changes**\n* **Unusual bleeding or discharge**\n\nCancer is a serious disease, but it is often treatable if it is detected and treated early. Treatment options for cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nIf you are concerned that you may have cancer, it is important to see a doctor right away. Early detection and treatment can improve your chances of a successful outcome.",
